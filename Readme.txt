For our TA's and Professors:

This program is meant to be run through the class called LoginPage. This is the "main" application.
Our application depends on an IPV4 address as far as we know to allow for multiplayer game. This address is to be
put in a total of 5 places. In our source code it is in ChatServer at line 28. in LoginController lines 63-65. and
LoginPage line 25. Furthermore the words.txt file path in SketchifyController line 251 may cause issues but should
be correct for you as well.
